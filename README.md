## Project Description

I built a lightweight React web app in under 2 hours using Vercel, GitHub, and Supabase. The app lets users submit a string of text (like a URL, note, or message), and generates a short code. That code can be used later — on the same or a different device — to retrieve the original string.

It’s a fast and simple way to share small bits of text across devices or with friends, without needing to sign in or use a messaging app.

## How it works

1. Paste or type a string into the input field.
2. Click "Generate Share Code" to get a unique short code.
3. On any device, enter the code and click "Fetch Text" to retrieve the shared string.

## Tech Stack

- React for the frontend UI  
- Supabase for backend database and authentication  
- Vercel for continuous deployment and hosting

If you want me to generate the actual `README.md` file for you or add instructions for running the app locally, just say so!
